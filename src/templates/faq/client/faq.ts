We will then contact you to collect more information, if necessary, after which we will present you with your options based on your preferences. Once you're ready to book your vacation, we will collect any necessary credit card payments and process them through the supplier. A credit card authorization will be sent to you for your signature and to return to us. Once your vacation has been paid in full, you will receive your travel documents.",
