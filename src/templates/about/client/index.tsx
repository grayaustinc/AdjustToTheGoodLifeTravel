                My background is in healthcare, and I am a chiropractor in Raleigh NC for the last 26 years and a travel agent for the last 9 years. I launched Adjust to the Good
                Life Travel in 2013 based solely on my love and passion for travel! My dad was a Naval officer and we traveled extensively growing up when we lived in Europe. Our
                family loves exploring new destinations, experiencing unique adventures, and creating lifelong memories together. My daughter, Haley Gray has joined the family
                business and is now also a travel consultant with our travel agency.

                Our family has cruised over 25 different sailings to almost all of the Caribbean islands, Hawaii, Alaska, Europe, Tahiti, Galapagos and other exotic destinations.
                We have explored over 33 countries, and traveled to almost all of the states within the U.S. We also love exploring the U.S National parks and taking expeditions.
                As an experienced travel partner, I have the personal knowledge to help your family too! Having the personal knowledge of these destinations has enabled me to see
                first hand what my clients will experience.

                I hold one of the highest levels of certification within the cruise industry, as a Master Cruise Counselor designated through CLIA (Cruise Lines International
                Association). It is a rigorous program that includes first attaining Accredited Cruise Counselor status, after selling many, many cruises, inspecting and personally
                sailing on different types of ships. This program enabled me to experience a wide range of cruise brands and gain first hand knowledge so that I can create the
                perfect experience for my clients.
